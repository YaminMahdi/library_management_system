## Getting Started

This is my first JAVA Project.

It is all about a Library Management System.

## Folder Structure
  Just run "src\view\login.java".
The workspace contains three folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the folder of class file
